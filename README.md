# Upstox Project
This repository contains the implementation of the Upstox Assignment, adhering to the provided guidelines and best practices in iOS development. The project demonstrates the use of modern architectural patterns, reusable code, and adherence to swift core principles to ensure a scalable, testable, and maintainable solution.

Features

✅ Architecture
Implemented using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
Clear separation of concerns for enhanced scalability and maintainability.


✅ Reusable Code
Components designed to be modular and reusable across the application.
Adhered to protocol-oriented programming (POP) for flexibility and abstraction.


✅ Testable Code
Test coverage logic coverage 90% approx.
Unit tests implemented for critical components (e.g., ViewModels, Services).


✅ UI Design
User interface built to align with the provided design guidelines.
Clean and visually appealing UI components for optimal user experience.


✅ Animations
Integrated smooth animations for list view handling to enhance interactivity and user engagement.


✅ Documentation
Comprehensive code comments and markdown documentation.
Ensures ease of understanding for future developers or reviewers.


✅ Network Layer
A robust Network Manager to handle API calls efficiently.
Clean error handling and response decoding.


✅ Swift Core Principles
Utilized modern Swift best practices, ensuring code readability and performance optimization.
Leveraged features like generics, extensions, and closures for cleaner code.
